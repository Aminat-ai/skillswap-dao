## Contract Functionality

Queueing Transactions: Allows authorized users to queue transactions with a specified delay.
Executing Transactions: Enables the execution of queued transactions after the delay period has passed.
Cancelling Transactions: Provides a mechanism for cancelling queued transactions.
Access Control: Ensures only authorized users can queue, execute, or cancel transactions.
Error Handling: Implements error handling for various scenarios like invalid timestamps, transaction not found, etc.

## Potential Use Cases
DAO governance: Time-locked proposals for DAO decisions.
Escrow services: Holding funds until specific conditions are met.
Automated tasks: Scheduling recurring tasks on the blockchain.

## Future Improvements
Security Audits: Conduct thorough security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
Gas Optimization: Optimize the contract for gas efficiency.
Additional Features: Explore adding features like multi-signature approvals or more complex transaction conditions.
